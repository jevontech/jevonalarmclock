# JevonAlarmClock #

The JevonAlarmClock was developed for the Keil/ARM "ARM Microcontroller Design Contest 2015".
The goal of the project was to develop a alarmclock that can connect to the Internet to get the current time. 
Furthermore it should control a Philips Hue lamp in order to gently wake you up in the morning.
