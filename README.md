# JevonAlarmClock #

The JevonAlarmClock was developed for the Keil/ARM "ARM Microcontroller Design Contest 2015".
The goal of the project was to develop an alarm clock that can connect to the Internet to get the current time. 
Furthermore it should be able to control a Philips Hue lamp in order to gently wake you up in the morning.
